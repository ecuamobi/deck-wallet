Deck Wallet
===========

Store your Bitcoins in a deck of cards.

# What is this?
A simple Android application that allows you to generate up to 52 bitcoin addresses
by entering the order of a deck of cards plus an optional password.

# About security
	* Completely offline, it does not requires any permissions.
	* You don't need to type anything (except the optional password), so it's not vulnerable to keyboard malware.
	* Protection against typos and miss-entered cards.
	* 2FA: Option to enter a password (or more than one to create secondary wallets) besides the deck itself.
	* Obscurity: An attacker won't know there are bitcoins in that deck, even if they find it.

# Instructions
	* Shuffle a deck of cards 7 times.
	* Select the number of cards to use. 52 is recommended.
	* Enter every card on the app.
	* Optionally enter a password you won't forget (it's not possible to recover it!).
	* Touch "Go!" to generate up to 52 bitcoin addresses.
	* Optionally, copy the order of the cards into another deck, as backup.
	* Double-check your deck wallet: Touch the 'Check' icon and re-enter the same password and card order.
	* After checking it, send some bitcoins to your deck wallet and store your deck of cards in a safe place.
